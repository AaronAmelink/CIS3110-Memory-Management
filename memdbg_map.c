/**
 * Print out a region of memory in map format to the screen,
 * arranging the data in a form reminicent of hexdump -C
 *
 * You probably won't need to edit this file.
 *
 * This function gets called from the "dump" functions, but
 * you can also call it yourself. 
 *
 * If you pass it the same pointer for "base" and "start", it will
 * begin its numbering from zero.  If you pass "((void *) 0)"
 * frequently known as "NULL", then it will tell you the absolute
 * memory addresses of the bytes it prints.
 *
 * The value "start" should be the real data you want to print;
 * nBytesToPrint is the number of bytes starting at that location,
 * and then "indent" simply shifts things over a bit on the screen
 * for reading.
 *
 * If you pass the same value for "start" and "base", then your
 * offsets will be numbered relative to the start of the block.
